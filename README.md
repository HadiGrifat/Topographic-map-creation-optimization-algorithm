# Topographic Mapping Project

A GPS data processing and topographic mapping system that implements advanced geometric algorithms for creating terrain models from GPS survey data as well as run analytical report to determine the health and quality of the terrain models.

## Overview

This project transforms raw GPS data (.gpx files) into topographic maps using multiple interpolation methods and advanced Delaunay triangulation techniques.
In addition we use several analytical method to determine the quality of mapping process such as triangle fatness measure and curvature measure around the mesh vertices, a.k.a the GPS data points.
