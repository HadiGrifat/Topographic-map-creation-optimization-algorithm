## Research Foundation

### Article 1: "Sampling and Reconstruction of Surfaces and Higher Dimensional Manifolds" (Saucan, Appleboim, Zeevi, 2008)

**Core Contribution**: Extends Shannon's classical sampling theorem from 1D signals to 2D surfaces and higher-dimensional manifolds using geometric principles.

**Key Theoretical Concepts:**

1. **Curvature-Based Sampling Density**
   - Sampling rate: `D(p) = D(1/k(p))` where `k(p) = max{|k�|, |k�|}`
   - k�, k� are principal curvatures at point p
   - Higher curvature � denser sampling required
   - Analogous to bandwidth in classical Shannon theorem

2. **Fat Triangulations**
   - Triangles with bounded angle ratios (avoid "sliver" triangles)
   - Quality metric: r/R e � (inradius/circumradius ratio)
   - Essential for accurate surface reconstruction
   - Prevents numerical instability in interpolation

3. **Geometric Sampling Theory**
   - Band-limited signals � bounded curvature surfaces
   - Osculatory radius determines local sampling requirements
   - Secant approximation for piecewise-linear reconstruction
   - Error bounds depend on triangle fatness and curvature

4. **Surface Reconstruction Methods**
   - Piecewise-linear (secant map) reconstruction
   - Better performance than Nyquist reconstruction (10x less error)
   - Smoothing techniques for non-C� surfaces
   - PL-approximation with �-accuracy guarantees

**Applications to Topographic Mapping:**
- Terrain complexity (curvature) should drive sampling density
- Steep areas need more GPS points than flat regions
- Delaunay triangulation aligns with fat triangulation concept
- Quality triangulation crucial for elevation accuracy

**Implementation Relevance:**
- Current pipeline uses uniform Delaunay triangulation
- Could enhance with adaptive sampling based on local terrain curvature
- Curvature computation from elevation data can guide point placement
- Quality metrics can validate triangulation effectiveness

**Mathematical Framework:**
- Manifold M with curvature bounds

### Article 2: "Geometric Approach to Sampling and Communication" (Saucan, Appleboim, Zeevi, 2012)

**Core Contribution**: Extends geometric sampling theory to information theory and communication systems, bridging geometric manifold sampling with classical Shannon theory.

**Key Theoretical Extensions:**

   - Geometric approach solves open problem of optimal quantizer dimension

3. **Vector Quantization Applications**
   - Voronoi cell complex construction from fat triangulations
   - Error bounds in terms of triangle fatness and diameter

### Article 3: "Provably Good Sampling and Meshing of Lipschitz Surfaces" (Boissonnat, Oudot, 2006)

**Core Contribution**: Extends sampling theory from smooth surfaces to Lipschitz surfaces, providing the first provably correct algorithm for meshing non-smooth surfaces with topological and geometric guarantees.

**Key Theoretical Innovations:**

1. **Lipschitz Radius Concept**
   - New measurable quantity: `lrk(p)` = radius of largest ball where surface is graph of k-Lipschitz function
   - Replaces local feature size (lfs) for non-smooth surfaces
   - Well-defined and positive for much larger class of shapes than smooth surfaces
   - 1-Lipschitz continuous function: preserves geometric structure

2. **Lipschitz Surface Classification**
   - Includes piecewise smooth surfaces with bounded normal deviation
   - Encompasses polyhedra with controlled dihedral angles
   - Differentiable almost everywhere (Rademacher's theorem)
   - Pseudo-normal `nk(p)` replaces traditional surface normal

3. **Sampling Conditions for Non-Smooth Surfaces**
   - ε-samples: `∀p ∈ S, E ∩ B(p, ε·lrk(p)) ≠ ∅`
   - Loose ε-samples: relaxed density requirements
   - Bounded skinny triangle condition: radius-edge ratio ≤ ρ
   - Maintains same guarantees as smooth case

4. **Restricted Delaunay Triangulation Properties**
   - 2-manifold without boundary (topological correctness)
   - Hausdorff distance O(ε) from original surface (geometric accuracy)
   - Isotopic to original surface (topological equivalence)
   - Works with Chew's refinement algorithm

**Technical Framework:**

- **Cocone Lemma**: Local geometric constraints for Lipschitz surfaces
- **Triangle Normal Control**: Bounds on triangle normal deviation
- **Normal Variation**: Pseudo-normal consistency across surface
- **Weak Feature Size**: Connection to broader geometric measure theory

**Algorithmic Applications:**
- Delaunay refinement algorithm proven correct for Lipschitz surfaces
- No special handling needed for singular points
- Same complexity bounds as smooth case: O(Area(S)/ε²) vertices
- Automatic quality mesh generation with angle bounds

**Practical Significance:**
- First provably correct non-smooth surface meshing algorithm
- Handles real-world surfaces with corners, edges, and discontinuities
- Applications to CAD models, architectural surfaces, geological terrain
- Robust to measurement noise and discretization artifacts

**Implementation Requirements:**

- Triangle quality (skinnyness) monitoring

**Mathematical Guarantees:**
